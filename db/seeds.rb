# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# joanna= User.create!(username: "joey", password: "joey")

# walk_dog = Todo.create!(title: "walk dog", content: "walk the dog twice around the block", completed: false)
